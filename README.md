# Runner-Training

### Overview
It is important for runners to get adequate training before taking on long distance running events. Finding a training plan to match your goal distance is a good first step. However, even after you’ve found a good training plan, it is sometimes difficult to get motivated to run some of the long runs. That is when it can be helpful to find local races or running groups to run with.

I am creating an app that will help users find training plans to match their goals. In addition, this app will help users find races and running groups that fit into their training schedule. Each user will have a personal calendar populated with their training runs as well as any race or running group options available. This idea stems from how I build my training schedule for ultramarathons. I have run distances of 50 and 100 miles using this strategy.

### Features
#### User Signup:
Users will be able to create a new profile for themselves, allowing them to set up their own running calendar and mileage tracker.

#### User login:
Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.

#### Search:
Users will be able to search for running events based on date and/or distance.

#### Add Event:
Users will be able to add running events to the schedule on their profile page.

#### Log Mileage:
Users will be able to record completed running mileage in their schedule/tracker.

### What I'll Have to Learn
In the course of building this project, I will collect data from online race calendars and training plans to add to my database for users to search.  I’ll also need to learn how to add a calendar widget to user profile pages.

### Project Tracker
I will be using Pivotal to track my project: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2186249.
